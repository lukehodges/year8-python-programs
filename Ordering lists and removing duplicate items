### Ordering strings and removing duplicates
### Luke Hodges

# creating our list file that we want to sort
data = [1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 8, 9, 7, 7, 11, 10, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 3, 4, 3, 10]

# print out list of data
for i in data:
	print(i)

# sorting data numerically
data.sort(reverse = False)

# printing the rearanged data
print(data)

# removing duplicates from list
data = list(dict.fromkeys(data))
# printing the new list
print(data)

### --- NOTE ---
#  you could just use the last two lines of code and have the list stored
# in a variable but by sorting the list, you can write systems like the
# highest interest on a card or most valuable assets
